## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Practices
- **Incremental Development:** Complete one task at a time, test thoroughly before moving to next
- **User Feedback Integration:** Test with real users throughout development
- **Performance Monitoring:** Track key metrics from day one
- **Security First:** Consider security implications for every feature

### Quality Gates
- **Phase 1:** Payment processing and video tracking must work perfectly
- **Phase 2:** Content management and analytics must be functional
- **Phase 3:** System must be ready for public launch with legal compliance

### Risk Management
- **Technical Risks:** Have backup plans for YouTube API changes
- **Business Risks:** Monitor Firebase usage to avoid surprise costs
- **Legal Risks:** Consult legal expert before launch
- **User Experience Risks:** Test with real users throughout development

### Success Metrics
- Complete purchase-to-learning flow works end-to-end
- Video progress tracking is 99%+ accurate
- Payment processing has <2% failure rate
- Page load times <3 seconds on mobile
- Support system handles 95% of inquiries without human intervention

This implementation plan builds on the existing foundation and prioritizes revenue generation while ensuring a quality user experience. Each task is designed to be completed independently and builds incrementally toward a fully functional LMS.
